# Abstract
Legacy and lack of full standardisation of solar imaging metadata lead to complicated conditional processing at the time of image display in the Helioviewer system. This HEP attempts attempts to solve the problem by shifting this processing to the time of image preparation. The Helioviewer system clients would have access to uniform metadata.

# Detailed Description
There are two levels of metadata in the Helioviewer system:


1. Required (FITS keyword examples in brackets)

* Instrument identification: observatory (TELESCOP), instrument (INSTRUME), detector (DETECTOR), measurement (WAVELNTH)

* Date of start of observation (DATE-OBS in UTC time scale)

* WCS information about mapping between pixel space and the observed scene:
  * coordinate frame (WCSNAME, e.g. Helioprojective-cartesian, IVOA HPC)
  * reference point of the coordinate frame (CRVALi in CUNITi units)
  * projection type and axes (CTYPEi, e.g. tangential projection, helioprojective longitude and latitude: HPLN-TAN, HPLT-TAN)
  * number of image pixels (NAXISi)
  * pixel scale (CDELTi in CUNITi units)
  * reference point in the image frame (CRPIXi in pixels)
  * pixel linear transform (CROTAi - deprecated, CDi_j, PCi_j) - this is currently not used in Helioviewer as the images are supposed to have the vertical axis parallel with the solar rotation axis, with solar North on top. Transforming the images would place an undue burden on the helioviewer.org client.

* Instrument (observer, platform) location: currently DSUN_OBS is required. To enable 3D functionality, the location has to fully specified. The proposed reference frame is HEEQ (Heliocentric Earth Equatorial), in its spherical representation (DSUN_OBS [m], HGLT_OBS [degree], HGLN_OBS [degree]). The location is geometric (no aberration correction) at DATE-OBS time. This frame has the advantage that, for observers on Earth, HGLN_OBS = 0 and HGLT_OBS = B0 angle, which can be easily computed by the usual software. This is also what is used internally by JHV3D. However, other software may need to incorporate solar rotation computations if using this information.

* Metadata about transparent regions (may be alleviated in the future by alpha channel support in the JPEG2000 data), e.g. for coronagraph image.


2. Optional

* Information about the instrument: whom/how to contact/credit, website, reference paper

* Information about the definitive location of the science data: e.g., a VSO query http://sdac.virtualsolar.org/cgi/search?beats_me_how_to_get_a_rest_query

* Information about the JPEG2000 processing software and its execution: name, version, place, etc.

* Information about the original location of JPEG2000 file: e.g. http://proba2.oma.be/swap/data/qlk/2014/07/06/2014_07_06__19_24_52__PROBA2_SWAP_SWAP_174.jp2

There is already a standard for image metadata: XMP. It is supported in several image formats: PNG, JPEG, JPEG2000, TIFF, thus the metadata can be transfered also across image format conversions. Collages of images may also be supported.
